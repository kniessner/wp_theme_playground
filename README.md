Current versions:
Hybrid 2.0.4
Bootstrap Sass 3.3.3


This is a basic theme that can be used to get started with rapid Wordpress theme development.

It incorporates the Hybrid Core framework (http://themehybrid.com/hybrid-core) with Bootstrap Sass (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass).

Compile your Sass by opening your console/terminal, navigating to "shwib/_" and running "compass watch"

Edit Bootstrap variables in "shwib/_/sass/bootstrap/_variables.scss"

Replace "shwib/_/img/logo.png" with your fallback image for Facebook sharing

Includes:
- Basic Wordpress image styles
- Skip link for screen readers
- Logical tab order for keyboard navigation
- Simple drop down menu
- Basic comments styles
- Facebook open graph and Twitter cards mark up
- Favicon and app icons markup (see http://littlewebgiants.com/favicon-and-app-icon-template/ for how to generate all the images)
- Sticky footer
- Plus a bunch of other goodies from the Hybrid Core framework

Enjoy :)
